**DO:**

- Your sentences should be precise, expressing your ideas clearly.
- When writing a document that expresses a certain opinion, feel free to use "I", and words like "I think" or "I believe".
- Rely on the logical flow of ideas more than heavy transitions.
- Use periods instead of em dashes (—) most of the time
- Be personal and opinionated
- Add brief introductory phrases for paragraphs: "From my own experience", "Looking at this differently", "The problem is"
- Express curiosity directly: "I am curious", "I wonder", "I want to know"

**DON'T:**

- Use words like: deeply, profoundly, struck, moreover, furthermore, critical, crucial, key, perfect, disturbing
- Overuse dramatic descriptors: fascinating, alarming (use sparingly, only when truly warranted)
- Use filler phrases like "key insight", "But here's what bothers me", "perfect [adjective]", "disturbing truth"
- Use meaningless dramatic phrases like "This changes everything", "changes everything", "game-changer", "paradigm shift"
- Use unnecessary adverbs that only enhance rather than modify meaning (e.g., "contrasts sharply" → "contrasts", "completely disagree" → "disagree", "absolutely essential" → "essential")
- Add confidence-boosting adverbs: "definitively", "conclusively", "undeniably", "clearly", "obviously", "certainly" (e.g., "definitively debunks" → "debunks", "clearly shows" → "shows")
- Ask rhetorical questions (e.g., "Why do the least qualified speak loudest?" → "The least qualified speak loudest.")
- Write sentence fragments (e.g., "Not surprising." → "This is not surprising.")
- Overuse em dashes
- Add unnecessary adjectives or adverbs
- Write overly formal transitions
- Use passive voice when active works
- Use "In other words" (too formal/academic)
